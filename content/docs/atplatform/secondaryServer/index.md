atServers (personal atSign) provide the second tier of the atProtocol architecture and are responsible for answering lookups for specific atSigns. atServers provide the lookup service for a particular atSign and one name only. This ensures that the atServer will not mix atSign data with any other atSignâ€™s data. This is unlike web servers that can provide service to multiple websites at a time.
