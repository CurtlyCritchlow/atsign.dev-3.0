Our Dart/Flutter SDK takes full advantage of the atProtocol and implements all the necessary features like encryption key generation, cram & pkam authentication, verb building, end-to-end encrypted data sharing, encrypting self data, and much more.

## What's Covered

This is where you can quickly learn and update yourself on various atPlatform concepts.

If you haven't already, we recommend you head to [Get Started Flutter Development](/start/flutter/) first.

The following is covered in this codelab:

- [**Onboarding**](/sdk/flutter/onboarding/) - process of activating an atSign and/or authenticating the atSign into its secondary server.
- [**AtClientPreference**](/sdk/flutter/at_client_preference/) - object used to configure preferences in your atPlatform application such as the namespace, hiveStoragePath, and maxDataSize.
- [**AtClientManager**](/sdk/flutter/at_client_manager/) - an object with various services such the Client, the NotificationService, and the SyncService.
- [**Key Basics**](/sdk/flutter/key_basics/) - learn how keys are stored in the atServer and how to manipulate them.
